# A card game (Skypro course project)
This project is developed as part of the course in web development at the online school [Skypro](https://sky.pro/). 

It is a simple web card game with three levels of difficulty. The game trains your attention. You are given 5 seconds to memorize the location of all pairs of cards, and then the cards are turned over and you have to find all the pairs. There is only one try!

This project is in a **SPA-format** and has no backend. It was originally written in ***JavaScript***, then converted to ***TypeScript***.
